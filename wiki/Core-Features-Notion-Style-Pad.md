# Feature: Notion-Style Pad

HighLaunchPad includes a "Notion-Style Pad," a versatile block-based editor for notes, documentation, content drafting, and knowledge management. This feature is powered by Tiptap, a headless, framework-agnostic rich text editor.

*(Developer Note: This section is based on the `src/components/notionpad/` directory, the `@tiptap/*` dependencies in `package.json`, and the general concept of a Notion-like editor.)*

## Overview

The Notion-Style Pad provides a flexible and intuitive way to create and organize rich text content. It mimics the block-based editing experience popularized by tools like Notion, allowing users to easily structure their thoughts and documents.

Key aspects:

*   **Block-Based Editing:** Content is organized into blocks (paragraphs, headings, lists, images, etc.), which can be easily added, manipulated, and reordered.
*   **Rich Text Formatting:** Supports a wide range of formatting options, including bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, headings, lists (bulleted and numbered), blockquotes, code blocks, and links.
*   **Tiptap Powered:** Built using the Tiptap editor framework (`@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`, etc.), known for its extensibility and headless nature.
*   **AI Assistance:** Likely integrates with HighLaunchPad's [AI Content Engine](Core-Features-AI-Powered-Content-Engine.md) for tasks like text generation, summarization, or rephrasing directly within the editor (`src/components/notionpad/ai-assist-dialog.tsx`).
*   **Slash Commands / Bubble Menu:** May feature intuitive ways to add blocks or apply formatting, such as typing "/" to bring up a command menu or a contextual bubble menu for selected text (`src/components/notionpad/bubble-menu.tsx`).

## Using the Notion-Style Pad

*(Developer Note: The following sub-sections are speculative based on common Tiptap implementations and the file structure. These should be verified against the actual UI and functionality in `src/app/dashboard/notion-pad/` or wherever this feature is primarily accessed.)*

### 1. Accessing the Pad

*   Navigate to **Dashboard > Notion Pad** (or a similar path, e.g., it might be part of a "Notes" or "Documents" section).
*   You might be able to create new pages/documents or open existing ones.

### 2. The Editor Interface

*   **Main Content Area:** A clean writing surface where you create and edit your content.
*   **Block-Based Structure:** Each piece of content (paragraph, heading, image) is treated as a distinct block (`src/components/notionpad/editor-block.tsx`).
*   **Toolbar / Bubble Menu:**
    *   A floating toolbar (bubble menu) might appear when you select text, offering common formatting options (bold, italic, link, etc.).
    *   A fixed toolbar might also be present at the top of the editor.
*   **Slash Commands:** Typing `/` on a new line might open a menu of available blocks you can insert (e.g., `/heading1`, `/image`, `/list`).

### 3. Creating and Formatting Content

*   **Adding Text:** Simply type to create new paragraphs.
*   **Applying Formatting:**
    *   Use the bubble menu or toolbar.
    *   Use standard keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+B` for bold).
    *   Use Markdown-like shortcuts (e.g., typing `# ` for H1, `* ` for a bullet list).
*   **Adding Blocks:**
    *   Use slash commands.
    *   There might be an "Add Block" button or menu.
*   **Common Block Types (expected based on Tiptap Starter Kit):**
    *   Paragraphs
    *   Headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
    *   Bulleted Lists
    *   Numbered Lists
    *   Blockquotes
    *   Code Blocks
    *   Horizontal Rules
    *   Links
    *   (Potentially Images, Tables, if those Tiptap extensions are used)

### 4. AI Assistance

*   An "AI Assist" button or option (`src/components/notionpad/ai-assist-dialog.tsx`) might be available.
*   **Functionality could include:**
    *   **Text Generation:** Provide a prompt to generate a paragraph, outline, or ideas.
    *   **Summarization:** Summarize selected text or the entire document.
    *   **Rephrasing:** Rewrite selected text in a different tone or style.
    *   **Continue Writing:** Have the AI continue writing from your current cursor position.
    *   **Brainstorming:** Ask the AI for ideas on a specific topic.
*   Requires an AI API Key. See [AI-Powered Content Engine](Core-Features-AI-Powered-Content-Engine.md).

### 5. Organizing Content

*   **Pages/Documents:** The Pad likely allows for multiple pages or documents.
*   **Nesting/Hierarchy:** You might be able to create nested pages or a folder-like structure for organization (common in Notion-like tools).

## Potential Use Cases

*   **Note-Taking:** Quickly jot down ideas, meeting notes, or research.
*   **Content Drafting:** Write blog posts, email copy, video scripts, or social media content before moving it to other tools.
*   **Internal Documentation:** Create guides, SOPs, or knowledge bases for your business.
*   **Brainstorming & Outlining:** Use the flexible editor and AI tools to brainstorm ideas and structure your thoughts.
*   **Personal Knowledge Management:** Keep track of learnings, resources, and personal projects.

The Notion-Style Pad in HighLaunchPad offers a powerful and flexible environment for all your text-based content creation and organization needs, enhanced by integrated AI capabilities. Check out the components in `src/components/notionpad/` for more insight into its specific building blocks.
