# Feature: Email Marketing Automation

HighLaunchPad includes robust Email Marketing Automation features, allowing you to nurture leads, engage subscribers, and drive sales through targeted email campaigns.

*(Developer Note: This section is based on the features outlined in the main README.md: "Visual sequence builder", "Trigger-based campaigns", "SMTP integration (SendGrid, Mailgun)", "Advanced segmentation". The actual implementation details in `src/app/dashboard/email/` would provide more specific information.)*

## Overview

Email marketing is a critical component for any online business. HighLaunchPad aims to provide tools that cover the entire email marketing lifecycle, from capturing leads to sending automated follow-up sequences.

Key aspects mentioned in the project vision:

*   **Visual Sequence Builder:** Design email workflows and automation sequences using a visual interface. This might leverage a library like Reactflow, similar to the Workflow Automation Builder.
*   **Trigger-Based Campaigns:** Send emails automatically based on user actions (e.g., form submission, link click, product purchase) or time delays.
*   **SMTP Integration:** Connect with popular email sending services like SendGrid or Mailgun to ensure reliable email delivery.
*   **Advanced Segmentation:** Group your contacts based on various criteria (e.g., tags, purchase history, engagement) to send highly relevant messages.
*   **Templates:** Pre-built email templates (`src/lib/email-templates.ts`) to get started quickly.

## Using Email Marketing Automation

*(Developer Note: The following sub-sections are speculative based on common email marketing platform features and the project's stated goals. These should be verified against the actual implementation in `src/app/dashboard/email/` and related components/libraries like Tiptap for email editing.)*

### 1. Setting up SMTP Integration

*   Navigate to **Dashboard > Settings > Email Settings** (or a similar path).
*   Configure your chosen SMTP provider (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun) by entering API keys and other necessary credentials.
*   This ensures that emails sent from HighLaunchPad are delivered through your preferred service.

### 2. Managing Subscribers & Lists

*   **Import Contacts:** Options to import existing subscriber lists (e.g., via CSV).
*   **List Management:** Create and manage different email lists for various audiences or campaigns.
*   **Segmentation:**
    *   Define rules to create dynamic segments of your audience.
    *   Examples: "Subscribers who clicked X link," "Customers who purchased Y product," "Leads interested in Z topic."
*   **Contact Profile:** View individual contact details, engagement history, and assigned tags/segments.

### 3. Creating Email Campaigns

*   **Campaign Types:**
    *   **Broadcasts:** One-time email blasts to a list or segment.
    *   **Automated Sequences (Workflows):** Series of emails sent automatically based on triggers and conditions.
*   **Email Editor:**
    *   Likely uses a rich text editor (Tiptap is a project dependency) for crafting email content.
    *   May include options for personalization (e.g., `{{firstName}}`).
    *   Ability to use pre-designed templates or create emails from scratch.
    *   AI assistance for drafting email copy (leveraging the [AI Content Engine](Core-Features-AI-Powered-Content-Engine.md)).

### 4. Building Automated Sequences (Visual Builder)

*   Navigate to **Dashboard > Email > Automations** (or similar).
*   Use the visual sequence builder to map out your email workflows:
    *   **Triggers:** Start a sequence when a specific event occurs (e.g., "New Subscriber," "Form Submitted," "Tag Added").
    *   **Actions:**
        *   "Send Email": Choose an email template or draft a new one.
        *   "Wait": Add time delays between emails (e.g., wait 2 days).
        *   "Condition": Branch the workflow based on criteria (e.g., "If subscriber opened previous email," "If subscriber has X tag").
        *   "Add/Remove Tag": Update contact properties.
    *   Connect these nodes to create your desired automation logic.

### 5. Analytics and Reporting

*   Track key email marketing metrics:
    *   Open rates
    *   Click-through rates (CTR)
    *   Unsubscribe rates
    *   Conversion rates (if integrated with goals or sales tracking)
*   View reports for individual campaigns and overall list performance.

## Key Use Cases

*   **Welcome Sequences:** Automatically welcome new subscribers and introduce them to your brand.
*   **Lead Nurturing:** Educate leads over time and guide them towards a purchase.
*   **Onboarding Campaigns:** Help new customers get the most out of your product or service.
*   **Promotional Campaigns:** Announce new products, sales, or events.
*   **Abandoned Cart Recovery:** (If e-commerce features are integrated) Remind users about items left in their cart.
