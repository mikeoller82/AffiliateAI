# Feature: Affiliate Link Management

HighLaunchPad is designed with affiliate marketers in mind, providing tools to manage, track, and optimize affiliate promotional efforts.

*(Developer Note: This section is based on the features outlined in the main README.md: "Link shortening and tracking", "UTM parameter automation", "Campaign performance analytics", "Team collaboration tools". The actual implementation details in `src/app/dashboard/links/` (if this is the relevant directory) would provide more specific information.)*

## Overview

Effective affiliate marketing requires careful management of promotional links and analysis of their performance. HighLaunchPad aims to simplify these tasks.

Key aspects mentioned in the project vision:

*   **Link Shortening and Tracking:** Create custom short links for your affiliate offers that also track clicks and other engagement metrics.
*   **UTM Parameter Automation:** Easily add UTM parameters to your links to track campaign sources, mediums, and other details in your analytics platforms.
*   **Campaign Performance Analytics:** Get insights into how your affiliate links are performing, including clicks, conversions (if integrated), and potentially earnings.
*   **Team Collaboration Tools:** (If applicable) Features for teams working on affiliate marketing campaigns.

## Using Affiliate Link Management

*(Developer Note: The following sub-sections are speculative based on common affiliate link management features and the project's stated goals. These should be verified against the actual implementation, likely within `src/app/dashboard/links/` or a similar section.)*

### 1. Adding and Organizing Affiliate Links

*   Navigate to **Dashboard > Links** (or a similar path).
*   **Add New Link:**
    *   Input the original affiliate URL (destination URL).
    *   Optionally, customize the short link slug (e.g., `yourdomain.com/recommends/product-name`).
    *   Add notes or tags for organization.
*   **Categorization/Grouping:** Organize links by product, vendor, or campaign.

### 2. Link Shortening and Customization

*   The platform should automatically generate a shortened version of your affiliate link.
*   Options might exist to connect a custom short domain.

### 3. UTM Parameter Automation

*   When creating or editing a link, there should be an interface to easily build UTM parameters:
    *   `utm_source`: The platform or website where the link is shared (e.g., `blog`, `twitter`, `newsletter`).
    *   `utm_medium`: The marketing medium (e.g., `social`, `email`, `cpc`).
    *   `utm_campaign`: The specific promotion or campaign name.
    *   `utm_term`: (Optional) Keywords for paid search.
    *   `utm_content`: (Optional) To differentiate ads or links that point to the same URL.
*   The system might allow saving UTM presets.

### 4. Tracking and Analytics

*   **Dashboard Overview:** A summary of overall link performance (total clicks, top links, recent activity).
*   **Individual Link Stats:**
    *   Click counts over time.
    *   Geographic data of clicks.
    *   Referrer information.
    *   Conversion data (if the platform supports conversion tracking pixels or integrations with affiliate networks/payment platforms).
*   **Campaign Reports:** Group link performance by campaign tags or UTM parameters.

### 5. Advanced Features (Potential)

*   **Link Cloaking:** Hiding the affiliate URL from the user until the click-through.
*   **Rotators:** Group multiple affiliate links under a single rotator link, useful for A/B testing offers or distributing traffic.
*   **Conversion Tracking:**
    *   This is a crucial feature. It might involve placing a tracking pixel on the merchant's thank-you page or direct integration with affiliate platforms.
    *   *(Developer Note: The method for conversion tracking needs to be clearly documented based on its implementation.)*
*   **Broken Link Detection:** Periodically check if destination URLs are still active.

## Benefits for Affiliates

*   **Organization:** Keep all your affiliate links in one place.
*   **Efficiency:** Quickly create tracked short links with consistent UTM parameters.
*   **Insight:** Understand which links and campaigns are performing best to optimize your strategy.
*   **Professionalism:** Use custom short links that build brand trust.
