# Integrations

HighLaunchPad is designed to work with various third-party services to extend its functionality and connect with your existing toolset. This page outlines key integrations.

## Payment Processing

*   **Stripe:**
    *   **Purpose:** Handle payments for pro plans, marketplace transactions, or potentially within user-created funnels (e.g., selling products directly).
    *   **Setup:** Requires Stripe API keys (`STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) to be configured in your environment variables.
    *   **Implementation:** Uses `@stripe/stripe-js` for frontend elements and likely Stripe's Node.js library for backend operations. Relevant code can be found in `src/lib/stripe.ts` and components related to billing (e.g., `src/components/dashboard/billing-form.tsx`).

## AI Services

*   **Google AI (via Genkit):**
    *   **Purpose:** Powers the [AI Content Engine](Core-Features-AI-Powered-Content-Engine.md) for tasks like text generation, summarization, and suggestions.
    *   **Model:** Uses Google Gemini models (e.g., `gemini-2.0-flash`).
    *   **Setup:** Requires a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in your environment variables.
    *   **Implementation:** Managed through the Genkit framework (`src/ai/`).
*   **Leonardo.ai (for Image Generation - Implied):**
    *   **Purpose:** The `next.config.ts` file includes `cdn.leonardo.ai` in its remote image patterns, suggesting an integration for AI image generation. The `src/ai/flows/generate-image.ts` flow likely handles this.
    *   **Setup:** Would require an API key or account with Leonardo.ai. Specific environment variables for this need to be identified from the implementation.
    *   **Implementation:** Check `src/ai/flows/generate-image.ts` for details.

## Email Delivery (SMTP)

The main `README.md` mentions planned or supported integrations for reliable email delivery at scale:

*   **SendGrid:**
    *   **Purpose:** Used as an SMTP relay to send emails generated by the Email Marketing Automation features.
    *   **Setup:** Would require a SendGrid account and API key, configured in environment variables.
*   **Mailgun:**
    *   **Purpose:** Similar to SendGrid, an alternative SMTP provider.
    *   **Setup:** Would require a Mailgun account and API key, configured in environment variables.

*(Developer Note: The specific implementation details for SMTP integration (e.g., library used, configuration UI) should be documented once available or confirmed from the `src/app/dashboard/email/` or settings sections.)*

## Authentication Providers (Options)

The main `README.md` suggests flexibility in authentication:

*   **NextAuth.js:** A popular authentication solution for Next.js applications, allowing various providers (OAuth, email, credentials).
*   **Clerk:** A complete user management and authentication platform.
*   **Supabase Auth:** Part of the Supabase BaaS platform.

*(Developer Note: The `firebase` dependency in `package.json` might also imply Firebase Authentication as an option or a currently used method. The primary chosen/default method and its setup should be clarified.)*

## Potential Future Integrations (Based on README & Common Needs)

*   **Affiliate Networks:** Direct integrations to pull sales data for affiliate link tracking.
*   **Social Media Platforms:** For content scheduling or social listening.
*   **Analytics Platforms (e.g., Google Analytics):** For more in-depth website and funnel tracking.
*   **Other Marketing Tools:** Zapier or Pabbly Connect for broader workflow automation with external apps.

## Configuring Integrations

Most integrations will require:

1.  **Account with the Third-Party Service:** You'll need to sign up for the respective service (e.g., Stripe, Google AI, SendGrid).
2.  **API Keys / Credentials:** Obtain API keys or other necessary credentials from the service provider.
3.  **Environment Variables:** Store these credentials securely in your `.env.local` file or your hosting provider's environment variable settings.
4.  **In-App Configuration:** Some integrations might require additional setup within the HighLaunchPad dashboard (e.g., selecting an SMTP provider, enabling certain features).

Refer to the [Getting Started](Getting-Started.md) guide for general information on environment variables and check specific settings sections within HighLaunchPad for UI-based configurations. As the platform evolves, more integrations will be added, and detailed setup guides for each will be beneficial.
