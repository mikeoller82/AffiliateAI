# Feature: Workflow Automation Builder

HighLaunchPad includes a Workflow Automation Builder, allowing you to design and implement custom automation sequences to connect various marketing, sales, and operational tasks. This feature is powered by Reactflow, enabling a visual, node-based interface.

*(Developer Note: This section is based on the "Advanced workflow automation" mentioned in the README and the `reactflow` dependency in `package.json`. The actual implementation details in `src/app/dashboard/automations/` and `src/components/automations/` would provide more specific information.)*

## Overview

Workflow automation helps you save time, ensure consistency, and create sophisticated interactions by automating repetitive tasks and processes.

Key aspects:

*   **Visual Node-Based Editor:** Uses Reactflow (`reactflow` dependency) to provide a drag-and-drop interface for building automation flows. You connect nodes representing triggers, actions, and conditions.
*   **Triggers:** Events that start an automation workflow.
*   **Actions:** Tasks performed by the automation.
*   **Conditions:** Logic that allows workflows to branch based on specific criteria.
*   **Integration with Other Features:** Workflows can interact with other parts of HighLaunchPad, such as the CRM, Email Marketing, and Funnel Builder.
*   **Templates:** Pre-built automation templates (`src/lib/automation-templates.ts`) for common use cases.

## Using the Workflow Automation Builder

*(Developer Note: The following sub-sections are speculative based on common workflow automation features and the project's stated goals. These should be verified against the actual implementation in `src/app/dashboard/automations/`, `src/components/automations/`, and `src/lib/automation-templates.ts`.)*

### 1. Accessing the Automation Builder

*   Navigate to **Dashboard > Automations** (or a similar path).
*   You'll likely see a list of existing automations and an option to create a new one.
*   You might be able to choose from a template or start from scratch.

### 2. The Editor Interface

The editor (`src/components/automations/flow-builder.tsx`) will typically feature:

*   **Canvas:** A large area where you drag and connect nodes to build your workflow.
*   **Node Palette/Sidebar (`src/components/automations/sidebar.tsx`):** A list of available trigger nodes, action nodes, and condition nodes that you can drag onto the canvas.
*   **Configuration Panel (`src/components/automations/config-sidebar.tsx`):** When a node is selected on the canvas, this panel allows you to configure its specific settings.

### 3. Types of Nodes (Examples)

**a) Trigger Nodes (Starting an Automation):**

*   **CRM Triggers:**
    *   New Contact Created
    *   Contact Tag Added/Removed
    *   Contact Field Updated
    *   Lead Score Reaches Value
    *   Contact Added to List/Segment
*   **Email Marketing Triggers:**
    *   Email Opened
    *   Email Link Clicked
    *   User Subscribes/Unsubscribes
*   **Funnel Triggers:**
    *   Form Submitted in Funnel
    *   User Visits Funnel Step
    *   Purchase Completed in Funnel
*   **Time-Based Triggers:**
    *   Specific Date/Time
    *   Recurring Schedule (e.g., daily, weekly)

**b) Action Nodes (Performing Tasks):**

*   **CRM Actions:**
    *   Create/Update Contact
    *   Add/Remove Tag
    *   Update Contact Field
    *   Change Lead Score
    *   Add Note to Contact
*   **Email Marketing Actions:**
    *   Send Email (select template, recipient)
    *   Add/Remove Contact from List
*   **Notification Actions:**
    *   Send Email Notification (to admin/team member)
    *   Send Slack Notification (if integrated)
*   **Integration Actions:**
    *   Call External API / Webhook (for advanced users)
*   **Delay/Wait Action:** Pause the workflow for a specified period.

**c) Condition Nodes (Branching Logic):**

*   **If/Else Logic:** Check if a certain condition is met and branch the workflow accordingly.
    *   Examples: "If Contact has 'VIP' tag...", "If Email open count > 0...", "If Lead Score > 50...".

### 4. Building a Workflow

1.  **Add a Trigger Node:** Drag a trigger node onto the canvas to define how the automation starts. Configure its settings.
2.  **Add Action Nodes:** Drag action nodes and connect them sequentially or in parallel after the trigger or other actions. Configure each action (e.g., select an email template to send, specify a tag to add).
3.  **Add Condition Nodes (Optional):** Use condition nodes to create different paths in your workflow based on data or events.
4.  **Connect Nodes:** Draw connections between the output ports of one node and the input ports of another to define the flow of execution.
5.  **Save and Activate:** Once your workflow is designed, save it and activate it to start processing events.

### 5. Managing Automations

*   View a list of all your automations.
*   See their status (active, inactive, draft).
*   View basic analytics for each automation (e.g., how many times it has run, number of contacts processed).
*   Edit, duplicate, or delete existing automations.

## Example Use Cases

*   **New Lead Welcome:** When a new contact is added via a funnel form, wait 10 minutes, then send a welcome email, and add the "New Lead" tag.
*   **Engagement-Based Follow-up:** If a contact clicks a specific link in an email, add them to a "High Interest" segment and notify a sales team member.
*   **Post-Purchase Sequence:** After a customer buys a product, send a thank-you email, wait 7 days, then send an email asking for a review.
*   **Lead Scoring Automation:** Increment a lead's score when they visit the pricing page or download a whitepaper. If the score exceeds a threshold, create a task for sales to follow up.

The Workflow Automation Builder is a powerful tool for streamlining your marketing and sales operations, allowing for highly personalized and timely interactions with your audience. Dive into `src/lib/automation-templates.ts` to see some pre-configured examples.
