# Feature: Smart CRM Dashboard

HighLaunchPad provides a Smart CRM (Customer Relationship Management) Dashboard to help you manage leads, track interactions, and build stronger relationships with your audience and customers.

*(Developer Note: This section is based on the features outlined in the main README.md: "Lead scoring and pipeline management", "Contact enrichment and tagging", "Activity timeline tracking", "Form integration and data capture". The actual implementation details in `src/app/dashboard/crm/` would provide more specific information.)*

## Overview

A CRM is the heart of managing customer interactions. HighLaunchPad's CRM is tailored for creators and digital entrepreneurs, focusing on simplicity and actionable insights.

Key aspects mentioned in the project vision:

*   **Lead Scoring:** Automatically score leads based on their engagement and attributes to prioritize follow-ups.
*   **Pipeline Management:** Visualize and manage your sales or lead nurturing process through customizable pipelines.
*   **Contact Enrichment and Tagging:** Add detailed information to contact profiles and use tags for segmentation and organization.
*   **Activity Timeline Tracking:** See a chronological history of all interactions with a contact (e.g., email opens, link clicks, page visits, form submissions).
*   **Form Integration and Data Capture:** Capture leads from website forms directly into the CRM.

## Using the Smart CRM Dashboard

*(Developer Note: The following sub-sections are speculative based on common CRM features and the project's stated goals. These should be verified against the actual implementation in `src/app/dashboard/crm/` and related components.)*

### 1. Accessing the CRM

*   Navigate to **Dashboard > CRM** (or a similar path).
*   The main view might be a list of contacts, a pipeline view, or a summary dashboard.

### 2. Contact Management

*   **Adding Contacts:**
    *   Manually add new contacts.
    *   Contacts automatically added via form submissions or other integrated lead capture methods.
    *   Import contacts (e.g., via CSV).
*   **Contact Profile:**
    *   View and edit contact details (name, email, phone, company, custom fields).
    *   **Tags:** Apply tags to contacts for easy filtering and segmentation (e.g., "Hot Lead," "Customer_ProductA," "Newsletter_Subscriber").
    *   **Activity Timeline:** A chronological log of all interactions:
        *   Emails sent, opened, clicked.
        *   Website pages visited (if site tracking is integrated).
        *   Forms submitted.
        *   Notes added by team members.
        *   Purchases made (if e-commerce is integrated).
    *   **Lead Score:** A numerical score indicating the lead's qualification or engagement level.
*   **Custom Fields:** Define custom fields to store information specific to your business needs.

### 3. Lead Scoring

*   **Rule-Based Scoring:**
    *   Set up rules to automatically adjust lead scores based on actions or attributes.
    *   Examples:
        *   "+10 points for opening an email."
        *   "+20 points for visiting the pricing page."
        *   "+5 points if job title contains 'Manager'."
        *   "-5 points for inactivity for 30 days."
*   The lead score helps identify high-potential leads that require immediate attention.

### 4. Pipeline Management

*   **Visual Pipelines:** Create and customize sales or lead nurturing pipelines (e.g., "New Lead" -> "Contacted" -> "Demo Scheduled" -> "Closed Won").
*   **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Move contacts between stages in the pipeline.
*   **Deal Tracking:** Associate deals or opportunities with contacts, including potential value and expected close date.
*   View pipeline reports to understand conversion rates between stages.

### 5. Form Integration and Data Capture

*   **Form Builder:** HighLaunchPad may include a native form builder (`src/components/forms/form-builder.tsx`).
*   **Integration with Website Forms:**
    *   Embed forms created in HighLaunchPad onto your website or funnels.
    *   Submissions automatically create or update contacts in the CRM.
*   Map form fields to CRM contact fields.

### 6. Segmentation and Filtering

*   Use powerful filtering options to create lists of contacts based on:
    *   Tags
    *   Custom field values
    *   Activity (e.g., "opened email X but did not click link Y")
    *   Lead score ranges
*   Saved segments can be used for targeted email campaigns or automation workflows.

## Benefits

*   **Centralized Contact Data:** All your lead and customer information in one place.
*   **Improved Follow-up:** Prioritize leads effectively with lead scoring and pipeline management.
*   **Personalized Communication:** Understand your contacts better through activity tracking and segmentation, enabling more relevant messaging.
*   **Streamlined Processes:** Automate data capture and reduce manual data entry.
